@par Description

This directory contains a set of sources files that implement In-Application 
Programming (IAP) over Ethernet for STM32F2x7 devices. 
Two IAP options are provided: 
 - IAP using TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
 - IAP using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) 
User has select through compile options (in main.h file) to include one or both 
options.
Please note that for both IAP options, LwIP v1.3.2 is used as the TCP/IP stack.

@par Hardware and Software environment  
  
  - This example has been tested with the following environment: 
     - STM322xG-EVAL board RevB
     - Http clients: Firefox Mozilla (v3.6 and later) or Microsoft Internet Explorer (v8 and later) 
     - TFTP client: PC utility TFTPD32 (http://tftpd32.jounin.net/) is used as a DHCP server and a TFTP client
  
  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect STM322xG-EVAL board to remote PC (through a crossover ethernet cable)
      or to your local network (through a straight ethernet cable)
    - Use the Key push-button
    - STM322xG-EVAL jumpers setting

    (*) User have to provide the 50 MHz clock by soldering a 50 MHz oscillator (ref SM7745HEV-50.0M or
        equivalent) on the U3 footprint located under CN3 and also removing jumper on JP5. This oscillator
        is not provided with the board. 
        For more details, please refer to STM3220G-EVAL evaluation board User manual (UM1057).
    @Note: the default setting is MII mode, to change it to RMII mode refer to main.h file.

      - Open the Project.uvproj project
      - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files
      - Load project image: Debug->Start/Stop Debug Session
      - Run program: Debug->Run (F5)

   - TASKING
      - Open TASKING toolchain.
      - Click on File->Import, select General->'Existing Projects into Workspace' 
        and then click "Next". 
      - Browse to TASKING workspace directory and select the project: 
          - STM322xG_EVAL: to configure the project for STM32F2xx devices.
      - Rebuild all project files: Select the project in the "Project explorer" 
        window then click on Project->build project menu.
      - Run program: Select the project in the "Project explorer" window then click 
        Run->Debug (F11)

   - TrueSTUDO
      - Open the TrueSTUDIO toolchain.
      - Click on File->Switch Workspace->Other and browse to TrueSTUDIO workspace directory.
      - Click on File->Import, select General->'Existing Projects into Workspace' and then click "Next". 
      - Browse to the TrueSTUDIO workspace directory, select the project:
          - STM322xG_EVAL: to configure the project for STM32F2xx devices
